A small, dynamic, object-oriented language.  http://mike-austin.com/impulse
_______________________________________________________________________________

Impulse is a small, dynamic, prototyped-based object-oriented language that
aims to have simple syntax and semantics. It also aims to be lightweight,
reflective and open, and easily embeddable.  It borrows syntax and semantics
from other languages such as Ruby, Smalltalk, Dylan, Io, Lua and JavaScript
along with ideas from functional languages like Haskell and ML.

A core goal is too keep the language, both the implementation and the syntax,
small and lightweight.  Impulse tries to factor special syntax such as pattern
matching and list comprehension into the language using predicates.

FEATURES

  * Prototype Based
    Singletons are easy to create, and objects can change behavior by switching
    their parent prototypes.

  * Small and lightweight
    The core is less than 2,000 lines of lightweight C++, including the VM,
    parser and garbage collector.

  * Reflective and Open
    All objects, including native C++ prototypes can be extended and modified.
    Everything is a first class object.

  * Easily Embeddable
    The language was designed from the bottom up, to provide the most simple
    interface to the runtime.

EXAMPLES

  # Get a list of even numbers between 1 and 10
    [1..10] map: |n| n even ? n * n

  # The ubiquitous factorial example
    factorial = |n| n == 0 ? 1 : n * factorial [n - 1]

COMPILING

  Compiling should be as easy as "make && sudo make install". Impulse has been
  tested with GCC 4.3.3 on Ubuntu 32/64, GCC 4.0.1 on MacOS X, and MinGW GCC
  3.4.5 on Windows.
